# Project 2

## Proposal

We are a new internet provider, No World Border, who is looking to expand to the global market. We will be examining different countries throughout the years to track the increase in internet use and where these increases thrive. We will compare this data to the global HDI (Human Development Index) as well to determine which country is the best fit for our new headquarters.


## Finding Data

In order to aquire our data, we used a few sources. These include Kaggle and the Human Development Reports website. Our sources comprise of excel files and csv files. 


## Report

*Extract*

We extracted our data using the Excel dataset from undp.org and the csv dataset from kaggle.com. 

*Transform*

Once we read the data from the Human Development site, we were able to witness a general steady increase in internet usage across the globe. We cleaned this data by selecting only the "Year" column equal to 2020 in order to narrow down our results and focus on a recent year of findings. We also dropped null or blank rows in the "Entity" column to minimize skewed results. After this was complete, we dropped the "Unnamed:0" and "Year" columns to continue narrowing down our findings. So that data could be more easily interpreted, we renamed the "Entity" column to "Country".  

Next, we merged this data with the excel data found on Kaggle, and we cleaned it up by reordering the columns, and checking for any duplicates. We converted our dataframe to a list of dictionaries, and it was ready for the next step.

*Load*

Once our data was collected and transformed, we were able to load it into the non-relational database, MongoDB. We used MongoDB to accommodate our everchanging data like the percent of internet users changing over the years. We named our instance of MongoClient "mongo" and inserted our data (hdiInfo) into a collection using .insert_many. We queried the collection with "results" equal to list(hdiInfo.find()), and were able to successfully confirm that the data was loaded when seaching "for x in results".

## Conclusion 

In conclusion, No World Border was able to decide that Sri Lanka,  with an HDI rank of 73 and an Internet Users (%) of 35 would make the best headquarters for our new internet service company. HDI under 100 indicates healthy human development and 35% of the population being internet users allows for growth in the industry.

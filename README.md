## Project Proposal

We are a new internet provider looking to expand to the global market. We will be examining different countries throughout the years to track the increase in internet use and where these increases thrive. We will compare this data to the global HDI (Human Development Index) as well to determine which country is the best fit for our new headquarters.


## Finding Data

In order to aquire our data, we used a few sources. This includes Kaggle, the Human Development Reports website, and World Bank website as well. Our sources comprise of excel files and csv files.
